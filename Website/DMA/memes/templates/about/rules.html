        <h2>Dank Memes Army Rules</h2>
        <h4>A few rules to keep everyone safe and happy</h4>
        <p>Dank Memes Army is all about fun. It’s a place that gives people the power to make the world happier.</p>
        <p>To keep the awesomeness of our community going, treat your fellow Dank Memes Armygers as you would like 
            to be treated: with respect. We trust you to be responsible, and millions of users respect that 
            trust. Here are the basic rules developed according to this principle. Please 
            take them seriously and respect the spirit in which they were created.</p>

        <h6>No Pornography</h6>
        <p>Dank Memes Army is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. 
            We work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.</p>

        <h6>No gory and harmful content</h6>
        <p>Don’t post or comment with gory content or content that encourages others 
            to do things that might cause them to get hurt or to commit specific acts of violence, 
            especially kids. If posting graphic content in a news or documentary 
            context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand
            what’s going on in the content.</p>

        <h6>No hate speech and bullying</h6>
        <p>We don’t support content and comment that promotes or condones violence 
            against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, 
            gender, age, nationality, veteran status or 
            sexual orientation, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of 
            these core characteristics.</p>

        <h6>No spamming, manipulation and multiple account abuse</h6>
        <p>Everyone hates spam. Don’t post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content and comments 
            in order to increase views. Creating multiple accounts with
            overlapping uses or in order to evade the temporary or permanent ban of a separate account is not allowed.</p>

        <h6>No deceptive content</h6>
        <p>Don’t spread wrong information. Deceptive content, comment and account may 
            get removed depending on their severity.</p>

        <h6>No personal and confidential information</h6>
        <p>To protect the safety of private individuals, anything that reveals other people’s personally identifiable information 
            (including personal social media accounts of non-public figures without the consent of 
            the original party) is not allowed.</p>

        <h6>No illegal activities</h6>
        <p>Content depicting or advocating illegal activity will not 
            be tolerated. Such acts may be reported to law enforcement 
            and users committed these acts may be permanently banned from Dank Memes Army.</p>

        <h6>No impersonation</h6>
        <p>You may not impersonate others (person, group or brand) on 
            Dank Memes Army in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others.</p>

        <h6>No copyright and trademark infringement</h6>
        <p>Respect originality and creativity. Give credit where credit is due. We reserve the right to 
            reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those 
            usernames. Accounts using business names and/or logos to mislead others may be permanently banned.</p>
