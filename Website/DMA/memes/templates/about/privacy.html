        <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>Dank Memes Army is a media company. Our mission is to make the world happier.
                The Dank Memes Army services that link to this Privacy Policy provide
                fun ways for you to create, share, and discover the best content in the world.
                When you use these services, you’ll share some information with us.
                We want to explain clearly what information we collect, why we collect it,
                how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, 
                update, and delete your information.
            </p>
            <p>That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. We tried to write
                it in simple language with minimal legalese so it’s easy for you to
                understand. If you have any questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, please contact us.
            </p>

        <h4>Information we collect</h4>
            <p>
            There are three basic categories of information we collect:
            </p>
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Information you choose to give us</li>
                <li>Information we get when you use our services</li>
                <li>Information we get from third parties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's how we collect your information.</p>

        <h4>How we collect information</h4>
        <h6>Information you choose to give us</h6>

            <p>When you use and interact with our services, we collect the information 
                you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require 
                you to set up a basic Dank Memes Army account, so we need to collect a few 
                important details about you, such as: a unique username you choose, a password, 
                an e-mail address, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find 
                you, we may also ask you to provide us additional information that will be publicly 
                visible on our services, for example a profile picture, a name, or other identifiable 
                information. Our other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to 
                provide us with a debit card or credit card number and its associated account information.
            </p><p>
                You’ll also provide any information you send through our services, 
                such as post and comment uploads. Keep in mind that the posts and 
                comments you upload can be seen publicly, and can always be saved 
                and copied outside of our services. Please don’t share content you 
                wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
            </p><p>
                Lastly, when you contact us or communicate with us in any way, 
                we’ll collect any information you give us.
            </p>

        <h4>Users in the European Union and European Economic Area</h4>
            <p>If you’re a user in the European Union or European Economic Area, 
                please note that 9GAG Limited is the data controller of your information. 
                Here’s additional information we would like you to know:</p>

            <h6>Bases For Using Your Information</h6>
                <p>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions 
                    apply or are met. These conditions are called legal bases. At 9GAG, 
                    we rely on one of the following bases:</p>
                <ul class="browser-default">
                    <li>Contract. We may use your information because you’ve entered into an agreement 
                        with us. For example, when you buy our merchandise and have accepted our Terms and 
                        Services, we may use some of your information to collect payment and to make sure 
                        you receive the right product, at the right time, to the right address</li>
                    <li>Legitimate Interest. We may use your information because we - or a third party - 
                        has a legitimate interest. For example, we need to use your information to provide, 
                        maintain and improve our services. This includes protecting your account, uploading 
                        your posts and comments, providing customer support, and showing the best content you’ll 
                        like. Most of these services are free. To keep the lights on at 9GAG HQ, we may use this 
                        information to show you relevant ads. We believe legitimate interest does not outweigh 
                        your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we 
                        are using your data does not significantly impact your privacy.</li>
                    <li>Consent. We may ask for your consent to use your information for specific purposes. 
                        If we do, we’ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through 
                        your device permissions at any time. Even if we’re not relying on consent to use 
                        your information, we may ask you for permission to access data such as your location.</li>
                    <li>Legal obligation. We may use your personal information when we are required to comply with 
                        the law,
